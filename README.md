# Farid-Quantum-Command-State-Transitions-via-Farid-Quantum-Command-Units-FQCU-
his work introduces the Farid Quantum Command State (FQCS) and Unit (FQCU) in the TQTU framework, replacing superposition with deterministic photon-command updates. It unifies atomic to cosmic scales via a scale-invariant law, improves energy harvesting, and offers testable predictions with philosophical reflection.
